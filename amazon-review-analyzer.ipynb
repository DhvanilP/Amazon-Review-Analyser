I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands.

I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.\",\n",

Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn\\'t enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive.

       " 'I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I\\'m originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It\\'s not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon\\'s app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own \"Silk Browser,\" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon\\'s OS, but it should not take very long to do so.',\n",
